### About
This package is designed to help anyone hunt for Onion addresses subject to a set of keywords set by the user. The primary
design characteristic is to enable the user to define attributes/keywords that they would like to hunt on. All customizable
attributes are located within the `src/config.py` python file. This is the only object that should be edited by the user.

---
### Requirements

* *Python Version:* Python 3+
* *Packages:* See Requirements.txt
* *Tor:* Must be able to route traffic via a Tor Proxy
** Windows: I like Nord VPN's Onion VPN or the https://github.com/basil00/TorWall[Open Source Tallow Project]
** Linux: TBD - Still Need to Test.
